        <p>Extraordinary leader and problem solver with over 5 years of military service and a secret clearance. I am calm
        under pressure with superior time management and conflict resolution skills. With both my communication
        skills and willingness to help team members, along with other great qualities, I have been promoted to a
        supervisor position very quickly in both the U.S. Army, an automotive technician for a dealership and a Parts manager for heavy equipment rental.</p>
